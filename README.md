# OOP-in-Java
This repository contains examples and implementations of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. It is designed to demonstrate the core concepts of OOP, such as:

Classes and Objects: Creating and using classes, defining attributes, and working with object instances.
Encapsulation: Using methods to interact with object data.
Inheritance: Extending classes to inherit properties and behaviors (if implemented in the future).
Polymorphism: Demonstrating method overriding or overloading (if implemented in the future).
Abstraction: Simplifying complex realities using abstract classes or interfaces (if applicable).
